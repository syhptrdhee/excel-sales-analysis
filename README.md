# Sales & Profitability Analysis using Excel

## Project Overview
This project analyzes FMCG sales data to understand overall sales performance, brand and product contribution, and their relationship with business profitability. The dataset covers multiple years of sales activity and is structured around key metrics such as units sold, sales value, net sales, and gross margin.

The analysis explores how sales performance varies across time, brands, products, and regions, and how metrics such as YTD (Year To Date) and MAT (Moving Annual Total) can be used to read trends and provide a general view of business performance. All analysis is conducted using Microsoft Excel.
