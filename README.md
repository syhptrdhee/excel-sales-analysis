# Project Background
HealthMax is an FMCG company operating in the hair care category with multiple core brands and multi-region market coverage. The company possesses historical sales data covering brand performance, product categories, and promotional activities over several years.

However, this data has not been fully leveraged to understand market dynamics, product profitability, and business growth opportunities. This project focuses on analyzing historical sales data using Microsoft Excel to identify market trends, evaluate internal performance, and support business decision-making through a Net Revenue Management (NRM) approach, particularly in category development and future sales planning.

Insights and recommendations are provided across key areas:

-including market and category performance

-brand and product performance 

-profitability 

-promotion effectiveness.

An independent analysis was performed to evaluate historical FMCG sales performance 
  and identify growth opportunities using a Net Revenue Management framework.

## Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:
- Analyze sales performance and brand growth within a single supplier
- Identify product categories with the highest growth potential
- Evaluate product profitability and the impact of promotional activities
- Develop net sales projections up to 2024 based on historical performance

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project represents FMCG sales data with the following characteristics:
- Data period: 2018–2023
- Data granularity: supplier, brand, category, region, and time
- Key metrics: units sold, sales value, net sales, and margin
- Moving Annual Total (MAT) metrics are applied to analyze rolling 12-month market trends

This dataset represents a large-scale business dataset, covering multiple years, brands, and categories, enabling comprehensive performance and trend analysis.

## Executive Summary
 ### Overview of Findings
Based on the analysis of FMCG sales data from 2018 to 2023, HealthMax demonstrates a gradual recovery and growth trend following periods of earlier pressure. The analysis indicates that business growth is driven not only by increases in sales volume, but also by product mix, category composition, and promotional strategies.

Several categories exhibit strong and sustainable growth, while profitability analysis reveals that high-volume products do not always generate the highest margin contribution. These findings highlight the importance of applying a Net Revenue Management (NRM) approach to support effective business decision-making and future growth planning.
### Market & Category Performance
- Sales trend analysis shows a gradual recovery in HealthMax’s overall performance, driven primarily by two core brands, Shinez and Starbust.
- A Moving Annual Total (MAT) approach is applied to reduce seasonality effects and provide a more stable view of long-term market trends.
- The Organic category demonstrates the strongest growth, with unit sales increasing by more than 200% compared to the initial period, indicating a shift in consumer preference toward natural products.
### Brand & Product Performance
- Market share analysis indicates that Starbust holds a dominant position in the South region in 2023, making it a key strategic focus area.
- Profitability evaluation shows that several high-volume products generate relatively lower margins, highlighting opportunities for pack-size optimization and pricing strategy improvements.
- A product simulation for Starbust UltraSoft 50 ml suggests higher volume potential and improved net sales contribution compared to the 100 ml size, particularly to support consumer trial.
### Promotion Effectiveness
- Promotional activities for the Shinez brand are shown to contribute to sales uplift during specific periods.
- However, the analysis also indicates that promotions should be applied selectively to avoid margin erosion and remain aligned with long-term profitability objectives.
### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, key recommendations include:
- Prioritizing the development of the Organic category as a medium-term growth driver.
- Optimizing smaller pack-size strategies (50 ml) to increase trial and sales volume.
- Applying promotional activities more selectively, focusing on products with stronger margin contributions.
- Integrating Net Revenue Management (NRM) principles into sales planning, pricing, and product development strategies.
